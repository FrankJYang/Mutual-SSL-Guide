##  SSL-Guide

Basic Tutorial that teaches you how to set up a secure SSL with Liberty
### Step I: set up a basic liberty server
## Please refer to the IBM Cloud HelloWorld for a more comprehensive set-up

We utilize Apache Maven to build this project. Please refer to the Maven Website for instructions on how to install Apache Maven.

1.  Clone from the follow repositorary: https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/java-helloworld.git
2.  Move into the java-helloworld folder, then issue the command mvn clean install to create the /target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war file
3.  You should see the following output:
    ’’’
[INFO] Packaging webapp
[INFO] Assembling webapp [JavaHelloWorldApp] in [/[Insert-Directory]/java-helloworld/target/JavaHelloWorldApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT]
[INFO] Processing war project
[INFO] Copying webapp resources [/[Insert-Directory]/java-helloworld/src/main/webapp]
[INFO] Webapp assembled in [24 msecs]
[INFO] Building war: /[Insert-Directory]/java-helloworld/target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war
    ’’’
4.  while you are in the java-helloworld folder, run mvn liberty:run-server to start up the server Make sure you do not have a running application using Port:9080

5.  You should see the following output:
’’’
  [INFO]  The server defaultServer has been launched.
  [INFO]  Monitoring dropins for applications.
  [INFO]  Web application available (default_host): http://YourLocalAddress:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp/
  [INFO]  Application JavaHelloWorldApp started in X seconds.
  [INFO]  The server installed the following features: [servlet-3.1].
  [INFO]  The server defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet.
’’’
6.  Check out your default server using the http://[InsertLocalAddress]:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp/ from Web application available (default_host)
    


Servlet.java: annotation: @servletSecurity @HttpConstraint commented out basicAuthenticationMechanism for transportGuarantee, specify the path as javax.servlet.annotation.ServletSecurity.TransportGuarantee.CONFIDENTIAL (might be unnecessary, need testing)

index.html href: redirect to servlet or adminonly from server.xml

bootstrap.properties default http/https port location and context root

server.xml keyStore: default id and password basicRegistry: show user(name), user password, group(admin/user) httpEndpoint: called from bootstrap webApplcation: where the Servlet is stored (war file) traceSpecification: enable trace functionality

web.xml added the security constraint: transport guarantee confidential

"/finish/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/resources/security" removed the key

how it works: The client(browser/website) wants to access Liberty. key.jks is a self-signed SSL certificate. When the client visits Liberty, it checks its certificate with list of trusted CAs. In this case, since the cerificate was self-signed, we need to add a browser exception sayign that we trust this entity.

what is mutual connection? The website has its certificate attached to it. The server verifies the client certificate doesnt support jks
